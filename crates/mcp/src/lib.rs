//! CadKub MCP server.
//!
//! JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio (newline-delimited), implementing the MCP lifecycle, tools and
//! resources. Tools map onto the app's control-channel methods, served either by a headless
//! [`Headless`] session in-process or by a running app through its loopback control port
//! ([`Remote`]). Agents can type at the command line exactly like a user (`command_line`), call
//! any command with JSON (`execute`), inspect the drawing and render it to a PNG.
