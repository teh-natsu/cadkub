## Why CADCraft

- **The workflow you know.** Type `L`, click two points, type `@5<45`, press Enter. The command
  line, prompts with clickable `[Keywords]`, AutoComplete, object snaps, polar tracking, ortho,
  direct distance entry, window and crossing selection, grips, and right-click-to-repeat behave
  the way decades of drafting habit expect.
- **Open files.** DXF is read and written natively (ASCII and binary, R12 through 2018), and DWG
  files (R13 through 2018) open and save through the open-source acadrust library. Export to SVG
  and PNG today.
- **Fast and native.** Pure Rust and egui, no Electron, no web view. One binary on macOS
  (universal), Windows, Linux and FreeBSD, plus a WebAssembly build for the browser.
- **Built for agents.** Every menu item, tool and prompt is a command. Agents can type at the
  command line exactly like a person, call any command with JSON, inspect the drawing to verify
  their work, and render it — over MCP, a JSON control channel, or the CLI.
- **Free.** MIT OR Apache-2.0, with no account and no subscription.

## What works today

CADCraft is in early, fast development. Honest status (see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for parity
numbers):

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| Drawing area | Model space with adaptive grid, axes, pan/zoom (wheel, middle-drag, pinch), crosshair cursor with pickbox, UCS icon, ViewCube, viewport label |
| Command line | Prompts with keywords, history, AutoComplete, aliases, `@dx,dy`, `@d<a`, `#x,y`, direct distance entry, Enter/space/right-click to repeat, transparent commands, `.scr`-style scripts |
| Draw | LINE, PLINE (arcs, widths), CIRCLE (center/radius/diameter, 2P, 3P), ARC, RECTANG (fillet/chamfer), POLYGON, ELLIPSE (+arcs), SPLINE, POINT, XLINE, RAY, DONUT, TEXT, MTEXT |
| Modify | ERASE, MOVE, COPY, ROTATE, SCALE, MIRROR, STRETCH, OFFSET, TRIM, EXTEND, FILLET, CHAMFER, BREAK, JOIN, EXPLODE, rectangular/polar ARRAY, draw order, OVERKILL |
| Precision | Object snaps (endpoint, midpoint, center, geometric center, node, quadrant, intersection, insertion, perpendicular, tangent, nearest; deferred tangent/perpendicular for the first point of a line, e.g. belt lines tangent to two circles), polar tracking, ortho, grid snap |
| Layers & properties | Layers palette and Layer Properties Manager (on/off, freeze, lock, plot, colour, linetype), layer tools (isolate, freeze, off, lock, match, previous), Properties palette with per-object editing, linetypes, lineweights, colour index and true colour |
| Annotation | All DIM* commands with full DIMSTYLE variables, overrides and every arrowhead, associative dimensions that follow geometry, MLEADER, TABLE, TrueType fonts (`.ttf`, `.otf`, `.ttc` collections), MTEXT formatting codes (fonts, heights, colours, stacked fractions), our own single-stroke drafting font |
| Hatch & blocks | Pick-point hatch boundaries with islands, pattern, solid and gradient fills from our own pattern library, BLOCK/INSERT, attributes and nested blocks |
| Files | DXF read (R12–2018, ASCII and binary) and write (R2000), including dimension styles, associativity, tables and constraints; DWG read (via the acadrust library) and write (R2000); PDF plotting, SVG and PNG export. Entities CADCraft doesn't model yet are not kept on save: see [file-format parity](docs/file-format-parity.md) |
| Layouts & plotting | Paper-space layouts, viewports (scale, lock, per-viewport layer freeze), MSPACE/PSPACE through viewports, page setups, PLOT and EXPORTPDF |
| Parametric | Geometric and dimensional constraints, AUTOCONSTRAIN, PARAMETERS with expressions, conflict detection; constraints re-solve after every edit |
| Grips | Hot grips with Space to cycle Stretch, Move, Rotate, Scale and Mirror |
| Interface languages | English and Ukrainian (Українська), live switching and a remembered Auto/system-language choice; [details](docs/localization.md) |
| Automation | MCP server, JSON control channel, `cadcraft-cli` (info, convert, run, commands, mcp) |

## Quick start

```sh
git clone https://github.com/storytold/cadcraft
cd cadcraft
cargo run --release -p cadcraft -- --sample       # opens the sample drawing
```

Then try typing at the command line:

```text
line 0,0 @10,0 @0,5 c          a closed triangle
circle 5,2 1                    a circle
offset 0.25                     then pick the circle and a side
zoom e                          zoom to extents
```

The web build: `cd apps/cadcraft-web && trunk serve` (needs [trunk](https://trunkrs.dev)).

### Fonts

CADCraft never ships fonts; it uses the TrueType/OpenType fonts installed on your system. SHX
fonts (including big fonts such as `chineset.shx`) aren't read yet: text in an SHX style is drawn
with our own stroke font, and any character a text's font lacks (CJK, for example) is drawn from
an installed font that has it, preferring wide-coverage fonts such as Noto Sans CJK, Source Han
Sans, WenQuanYi, PingFang or Microsoft JhengHei. Two settings, set with `SETVAR` or (for every
run) an environment variable, steer this:

| Variable | Environment | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `FONTALT` | `CADCRAFT_FONTALT` | Font used instead of a text style font that can't be found (an SHX file, a missing TTF), by file or family name, e.g. `Noto Sans CJK TC`. Empty (default) = our stroke font. |
| `FONTFALLBACK` | `CADCRAFT_FONTFALLBACK` | Fonts tried first for characters a text's font lacks, comma-separated, e.g. `Noto Sans CJK TC, msjh.ttc`. |

`.` clears either one.

### Logs

The desktop app writes its `log` records to standard error and to `logs/cadcraft.log` in the
settings directory (Linux and the BSDs `~/.config/cadcraft/logs/`, or
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cadcraft/logs/`; macOS `~/Library/Application Support/CADCraft/logs/`; Windows
`%APPDATA%\CADCraft\logs\`; or under `CADCRAFT_CONFIG_DIR`). A start from a desktop menu or the
Dock has no terminal, so this file is what to attach to a bug report. Each launch moves the
previous log to `cadcraft.1.log` (and that one to `cadcraft.2.log`), so the log of a run that
crashed survives the next start. The file stops growing at 16 MiB. `--version` writes no file.

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `CADCRAFT_CONFIG_DIR` | Use this directory instead of the platform settings directory (the log goes to its `logs/`) |
| `RUST_LOG` | Log levels for standard error and the log file. Default: `info` for CADCraft's own crates, `warn` for everything else. env_logger-style directives replace that, e.g. `RUST_LOG=debug`, `RUST_LOG=warn,cadcraft_io=trace` or `RUST_LOG=info,wgpu_core=warn`; a directive ending in `*` covers every target starting with it (`cadcraft*=debug`). `cadcraft_engine=debug` also logs every command-line message. |

The logger is `apps/cadcraft/src/logging.rs`; the web build logs to the browser console instead.

## Drive it from agents, MCP and the CLI

```sh
# MCP server on stdio, headless:
cadcraft-cli mcp
# …or bridged to the running app (start it with --control 7979):
cadcraft-cli mcp --connect 127.0.0.1:7979

# One-shot headless runs:
cadcraft-cli run --sample --script 'CIRCLE 22,3 1\n' --save out.dxf --export out.png
cadcraft-cli info drawing.dxf
cadcraft-cli convert drawing.dxf drawing.svg

# Frame part of the drawing (model space, drawing units, lower-left corner first):
cadcraft-cli convert drawing.dwg detail.png --window 0,0,20000,15000
cadcraft-cli run drawing.dwg --cmd 'zoom {"mode":"window","p1":[0,0],"p2":[20000,15000]}' --export detail.png
cadcraft-cli run drawing.dwg --cmd 'select {"window":[[0,0],[20000,15000]]}' --cmd 'zoom {"mode":"object"}' --export sel.png
```

How image exports (PNG 2400×1600, SVG, PDF) are framed: `convert` fits the model-space extents.
`run --export` shows the current view when the script or commands changed it (`zoom`, `pan`,
`view.set`, …) and otherwise fits the extents too. `--window x0,y0,x1,y1` shows exactly that
rectangle, centred and scaled without distortion; `--view extents` or `--view current` forces
either framing. To frame a selection set, `zoom {"mode":"object"}` after selecting.

MCP tools include `command_line` (type at the prompt), `execute` (any command with JSON),
`inspect_drawing`, `query_entities`, `render` (returns a PNG) and, when connected to the app,
`screenshot` and `ui_click`. The desktop app's JSON control channel is documented in
[docs/control-protocol.md](docs/control-protocol.md).

## Architecture

```text
geom ─┐                       f64 geometry: arcs, bulges, splines, intersections, offsets
dxf   │  (standalone)         DXF tag reader/writer
color ┤                       colour index, true colour
doc   ┤                       drawing database, copy-on-write entity store (cheap undo)
fonts ┤ render               stroke font + TEXT/MTEXT layout │ display lists, linetypes, hatches, dims, CPU raster
io    ┤                       DXF mapping, SVG/PNG export
engine┤                       sessions, commands, command line + prompts, snaps, selection, undo
ui-egui · mcp                 the swappable egui front end · MCP server
apps: cadcraft · cadcraft-cli · cadcraft-web
```

Nothing below `ui-egui` knows about egui, so the front end can be replaced. `cargo xtask ci`
checks formatting, clippy, tests, asset attribution, the crate layering and the wasm build.

## Accessibility

Over the drawing area CADCraft hides the system cursor and draws its own crosshair. Tools that follow the system cursor (Windows Magnifier set to follow or centre the mouse pointer, other screen magnifiers, screen recorders, remote desktops) lose track of it there. Turn on **View ▸ Accessibility ▸ Show System Cursor** to keep a small system crosshair visible at the centre of the drawn one, or start CADCraft with the environment variable `CADCRAFT_SYSTEM_CURSOR=1` (on Windows, set it once with `setx CADCRAFT_SYSTEM_CURSOR 1` and start CADCraft again). Agents can switch it with the control channel: `ui.set {"systemCursor": true}`.

## Roadmap

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the stage, measured parity and the estimate of remaining work, and [docs/gaps.md](docs/gaps.md) for everything still missing.

## Downloads

**Download CADCraft** from GitHub: the [latest release](https://github.com/storytold/cadcraft/releases/latest) has every build listed below, and [all releases](https://github.com/storytold/cadcraft/releases) has earlier versions and their notes. `<ver>` in the file names is the version number, and `SHA256SUMS.txt` lists a checksum for every file.

### Windows

| Build | Installer | Portable |
|---|---|---|
| x64 (64-bit Intel/AMD) | `cadcraft-<ver>-windows-x64.msi` | `cadcraft-<ver>-windows-x64-portable.zip` |
| arm64 (Snapdragon and other ARM PCs) | `cadcraft-<ver>-windows-arm64.msi` | `cadcraft-<ver>-windows-arm64-portable.zip` |
| x86 (32-bit) | `cadcraft-<ver>-windows-x86.msi` | `cadcraft-<ver>-windows-x86-portable.zip` |

Installers and executables are code-signed.

The installer adds CADCraft to the Start menu and asks whether to add a desktop shortcut too (unticked by default). For a silent install with the desktop shortcut: `msiexec /i cadcraft-<ver>-windows-x64.msi /qn DESKTOPSHORTCUT=1`.

**If the app doesn't open on Windows:** the desktop app initializes only DirectX 12 by default.
Letting wgpu also create an OpenGL instance can crash some graphics drivers (AMD's
`atio6axx.dll`) before the window appears, so the app would flash in Task Manager and quit.
`WGPU_BACKEND` overrides the default for troubleshooting (for example `dx12` or `vulkan`). In
PowerShell, from the folder containing the executable:

```powershell
$env:WGPU_BACKEND = "vulkan"
& .\cadcraft.exe
Remove-Item Env:WGPU_BACKEND                     # restore the default for later launches
```

An explicit `gl` override can bring the driver crash back on affected systems. The macOS, Linux
and web backend defaults are unchanged.
