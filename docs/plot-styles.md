# Plot styles

A plot style table decides how objects print. CadKub applies it to PDF plots (PLOT,
EXPORTPDF and anything that plots through them). It also applies it to a layout shown with
**Display plot styles** on: on screen and in the layout's PNG and SVG exports.

## Tables

| Kind | Picks the style by | Styles |
|---|---|---|
| Colour-dependent (`.ctb`) | the object's index colour (a true colour uses its nearest index colour) | exactly 255, `Color_1` … `Color_255` |
| Named (`.stb`) | the object's **PlotStyle** property | `Normal` first, then any names |

A style can set these:

| Field | Meaning | "Use object" value |
|---|---|---|
| `color` | output colour, `"#rrggbb"` | absent / `null` |
| `grayscale` | print the colour as the grey of its luminance (Rec. 709 weights) | `false` |
| `screening` | ink intensity 0–100 %, mixing toward the white paper | `100` |
| `linetype` | linetype name (loaded, or from the built-in library; `Continuous` draws solid) | absent / `null` |
| `lineweight` | hundredths of a millimetre, 0–211; used when lineweights are plotted | absent / `null` |
| `end`, `join`, `fill` | line end, line join and area fill style | `object` |

Colour 7 prints black. `end`, `join` and `fill` are stored but not applied yet.

### Built-in tables

These are CadKub's own definitions, not copies of any vendor's files.

| Table | What it does |
|---|---|
| `default.ctb` | keeps every object property |
| `monochrome.ctb` | prints every colour black |
| `grayscale.ctb` | prints every colour as the grey of its luminance |
| `default.stb` | `Normal` (object properties), `Black`, `Screened 50%`, `Thick` (0.50 mm) |
| `monochrome.stb` | `Normal` prints black; `Screened 50%` prints black at 50 % |

A table kept in the drawing shadows a built-in table of the same name.

## Named plot styles

Layers have a plot style name (default `Normal`). Objects have `ByLayer` (the default), `ByBlock`
or a style name. `ByLayer` takes the layer's style. On layer 0 inside a block, that is the block
reference's layer. `ByBlock` takes the block reference's style. A name the table doesn't have
prints as `Normal`. A colour-dependent table ignores the property.

## Commands

- `pagesetup {layout, plotStyleTable, displayPlotStyles}` sets the layout's table and the
  Display plot styles flag. Without a layout, it reports the built-in tables in `plotStyleTables`.
- `plot` / `exportpdf {plotStyleTable}` replaces the page setup's table for one plot. `"None"`
  plots object colours.
- `plotstyle {name, handles?}` sets the objects' plot style. With nothing selected, it sets the
  current plot style for new objects (`CPLOTSTYLE`). Without `name`, it reports the current
  style and the named styles.
- `layer.set {name, plotStyle}` sets a layer's plot style.
- `stylesmanager {action, …}` manages the tables: `list`, `get`, `new` (`kind`, `from`), `set`
  (`style: {name, …fields}`, `removeStyle`, `description`), `delete`, `load` (`path` or `text`)
  and `save` (`path`, or returns `text`). Typed or chosen from **File ▸ Plot Styles...**, it
  opens the Plot Style Manager dialog.

## Table files

Tables are saved in our own format: UTF-8 JSON with a format marker. Fields left at "use the
object's" are omitted.

```json
{
  "cadcraftPlotStyleTable": 1,
  "name": "office.stb",
  "description": "Office pens",
  "kind": "named",
  "styles": [
    { "name": "Normal" },
    { "name": "Pen 5", "color": "#000000", "screening": 40, "lineweight": 35, "linetype": "HIDDEN", "end": "round" }
  ]
}
```

- `kind` is `colorDependent` or `named`.
- `end` is one of `object`, `butt`, `square`, `round` or `diamond`.
- `join` is one of `object`, `miter`, `bevel`, `round` or `diamond`.
- `fill` is one of `object`, `solid`, `checkerboard`, `crosshatch`, `diamonds`, `horizontalBars`,
  `slantLeft`, `slantRight`, `squareDots` or `verticalBars`.
- `color` may also be written `[r, g, b]`.

Reading fixes hostile values:

- Screening is capped at 100 and lineweights at 211.
- A colour-dependent table always gets 255 styles named `Color_n`.
- A named table gets unique style names (at most 1024), with `Normal` first.
- Files over 4 MB are refused.

Binary `.ctb`/`.stb` files are not read. We haven't found a public specification of that format.

## In DXF files

- The page setup's table is PLOTSETTINGS group 7, and Display plot styles is plot layout flag 2
  (group 70).
- Plot style names follow the DXF Reference. The named object dictionary entry
  `ACAD_PLOTSTYLENAME` is an `ACDBDICTIONARYWDFLT` whose entries name `ACDBPLACEHOLDER` objects
  (default `Normal`). Layers and objects point at them with group 390. An object without a 390
  is `ByLayer`. `ByBlock` isn't written, so it reads back as `ByLayer`.
- Tables kept in the drawing travel in the `CADCRAFT_PLOTSTYLES` XRECORD (JSON) of the named
  object dictionary.
