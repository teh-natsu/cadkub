# UI parity

> **Last reviewed:** 2026-10-10 · **Last updated:** 2026-10-10 · **Change:** minor (dynamic input pointer boxes #60 and press-drag selection windows #63 landed) · **Target:** Autodesk AutoCAD 2027 for Mac (26.0)

How CadKub's interaction compares with AutoCAD's: point entry, object snaps, tracking, dynamic
input, grips, selection, the command line, chrome and navigation. A drafter's speed in AutoCAD
comes from these, so "the command exists" isn't enough: it has to accept the same input, snap to
the same points and respond to the same keys. Work items: [gaps.md](gaps.md#uiux).

**Headline (estimated): UI/UX fidelity ≈ 43%.** The command line, point syntax, the common
running snaps, polar/ortho and the palettes are real. Object snap tracking, extension, parallel
and apparent-intersection snaps are toggles with no behaviour; dynamic input is a read-only
tooltip; FROM, M2P, TK and point filters don't exist; hot-grip options are advertised but
ignored; there are no context menus. Remaining: **≈ 110–170 Opus 5.5 hours**.

## How this was measured

- CadKub: read from the source on 2026-10-10 (main at bd2412f): `crates/engine/src/{prompt,
  snap, select, grips, lib, units}.rs`, `cmd/*`, `crates/ui-egui/src/*`. Not run in this pass.
- AutoCAD: behaviour observed black-box in the running AutoCAD 2027 for Mac
  (`plan/autocad/01-observed-ui.md`, local only, with reference screenshots that are never
  committed), its menu tree (`xtask/data/menu-catalog.txt`) and Autodesk's documentation.
- Weights (how often a drafter hits each area): point entry 15%, object snaps 15%, tracking and
  polar 10%, dynamic input 10%, grips 10%, selection 10%, command line 10%, chrome and palettes
  10%, navigation 5%, keyboard and context menus 5%.

| Area | Weight | CadKub | Weighted |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Point entry | 15% | 45% | 6.8 |
| Object snaps | 15% | 40% | 6.0 |
| Tracking, polar, ortho, grid/snap | 10% | 30% | 3.0 |
| Dynamic input | 10% | 45% | 4.5 |
| Grips | 10% | 40% | 4.0 |
| Selection | 10% | 40% | 4.0 |
| Command line | 10% | 60% | 6.0 |
| Chrome and palettes | 10% | 45% | 4.5 |
| Navigation | 5% | 55% | 2.8 |
| Keyboard shortcuts, context menus | 5% | 25% | 1.3 |
| **Total** | 100% | | **≈ 43%** |

## Point entry (≈ 45%)

| Input | AutoCAD | CadKub | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `x,y[,z]`, `@dx,dy`, `@d<a`, `d<a`, `#x,y`, bare `@` | yes | yes; `#` equals absolute because there is no UCS; Z parsed then discarded | `prompt.rs:147-180` |
| `*x,y` (WCS override) | yes | no | |
| Direct distance entry | yes, honours ortho, polar and tracking paths | yes, ortho; polar only through the UI's snapped cursor | `lib.rs:782-793` |
| Angle forms: `45d30'`, radians, grads, surveyor `N45dE` | yes | yes | `units.rs:141-197` |
| Architectural/engineering distances `5'6-1/2"` | yes | yes | `units.rs:93-140` |
| `FROM` (base point + offset) | yes | **no** | |
| `M2P` / `MTP` (midpoint between two points) | yes | **no** | |
| `TK` (tracking) | yes | **no** | |
| Point filters `.x`, `.y`, `.xy`, `.z` | yes | **no** | |
| Angle override `<45` | yes | not found | |
| Typed calculator `'CAL` | yes | no | |

## Object snaps (≈ 40%)

| Mode | AutoCAD | CadKub (`snap.rs:135-334`) |
|---|---|---|
| Endpoint | every curve, solid/3D vertices, dimension ends | lines, arcs, polyline segments, open ellipses and splines, ray base, solid/trace corners |
| Midpoint | every curve incl. ellipse/spline arcs, polyline segments | segments only; **none on circles, ellipses, splines** |
| Center | arcs, circles, ellipses, polyarcs | arcs, circles, ellipses |
| Geometric center | any closed polyline, spline | closed LWPOLYLINE only |
| Node | points, dimension definition points, text alignment points | POINT only |
| Quadrant | circles, arcs, ellipses | yes |
| Intersection | every pair, extended intersection | among up to 200 nearby primitives; ellipse/spline pairs approximate ([geometry-parity.md](geometry-parity.md)) |
| Extension | yes, with dashed extension path | **declared, never produces a point** |
| Insertion | text, mtext, blocks, attributes, attdefs | TEXT, MTEXT, INSERT; no ATTDEF or MLEADER |
| Perpendicular | every curve, deferred | lines, arcs, circles, xlines; deferred for the first point (#168) |
| Tangent | circles, arcs, ellipses, splines, deferred | arcs and circles; deferred for the first point; **no ellipse or spline** |
| Nearest | every curve | yes |
| Apparent intersection | projected intersection | **same as Intersection** |
| Parallel | yes, with parallel path | **declared, never produces a point** |
| Temporary overrides typed at a prompt (`END`, `MID`, `INT` …) | yes | **no**: the text arrives as plain input |
| Shift/Ctrl+right-click snap menu | yes | **no** |
| Tab to cycle candidate snaps | yes | **no** |
| AutoSnap marker, tooltip, magnet, aperture box | yes | marker per mode and name label; aperture from APERTURE; no magnet, no aperture box |
| OSNAPZ, 3D object snaps | yes | no |

## Tracking, polar, ortho, grid and snap (≈ 30%)

| Feature | AutoCAD | CadKub |
|---|---|---|
| Ortho (F8) | yes | yes (`snap.rs:503`) |
| Polar tracking increment | yes | yes, one increment, dashed ray and "Polar: d < a°" tooltip (`snap.rs:510`, `canvas.rs:838-843`) |
| Additional polar angles, relative to last segment | yes | **no** |
| Polar distance snap (PolarSnap) | yes | **no** |
| **Object snap tracking** (acquire points, alignment paths, intersections of paths) | yes, F11 | **toggle only**: the F11 button and flag exist, nothing acquires points or draws paths |
| Grid (rectangular, major lines, adaptive, limits) | yes | rectangular, major lines, adaptive display |
| Snap (rectangular, isometric, polar snap) | yes | rectangular from 0,0 only (`snap.rs:531`) |
| Isometric drafting (ISODRAFT, isoplanes F5) | yes | **status-bar toggle with no effect** |
| Drafting Settings dialog | yes | yes (`dialogs.rs:36-80`) |

## Dynamic input (≈ 45%)

AutoCAD's heads-up input (F12) has editable pointer-input fields (x, y), dimensional input
fields (length and angle) with Tab between them and lock icons, relative-by-default second
points, dimensional input on grips, a prompt with clickable options and a down-arrow menu.
CadKub has pointer input boxes since #60 (`crates/ui-egui/src/dyninput.rs`): value boxes
beside the cursor while a command asks for a point; second and later points default to polar
distance and angle (DYNPIFORMAT = 1 for Cartesian); `,` and `<` lock a value and move to the next
box; Tab types the separator; Enter sends a relative entry (DYNPICOORDS = 1 for absolute) and
fills an empty box from the cursor; a plain number stays direct distance entry. Missing:
dimensional input on grips (length/angle fields while stretching), lock icons, the prompt with a
down-arrow options menu (DYNPROMPT), and DYNDIM.

## Grips (≈ 40%)

| Feature | AutoCAD | CadKub |
|---|---|---|

| Text/MText grips | position, width, column grips | move the whole object |
| Hot-grip modes with Space/Enter cycling | Stretch, Move, Rotate, Scale, Mirror | yes (`canvas.rs:58-67`) |
| Hot-grip options: Base point, Copy, Undo, Reference, eXit | yes | **advertised in the prompt but not parsed**; the engine's JSON grip commands accept `copy`, the UI never passes it |
| Several hot grips at once (Shift-click) | yes | **no** (one handle) |
| Multifunctional grip hover menus (Add Vertex, Remove Vertex, Convert to Arc, Lengthen …) | yes | **no** |
| Grip dimensional input (length/angle fields) | yes | no |

| Tool Bar, File tabs, Start tab, layout tabs | yes | yes |

## Keyboard and context menus (≈ 25%)

- Shortcut table: 25 entries (Cmd shortcuts, F1, F2, F3, F7–F12) plus 21 command `.key()`
  shortcuts. AutoCAD for Mac's defaults are similar in number; F4 (3D osnap), F5 (isoplane), F6
  (dynamic UCS) are missing.
- Delete erases the selection on macOS (#64); Escape cancels.
- **No right-click context menus** anywhere: right-click is Enter, clear selection or repeat
  (`canvas.rs:651-660`). AutoCAD has context menus on the canvas (per selection, per command),
  the command line, palettes and tabs.
