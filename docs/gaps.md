# Where CADCraft falls short of AutoCAD

> **Last reviewed:** 2026-10-10 · **Last updated:** 2026-10-10 · **Change:** minor (merged main: rows closed or narrowed by #36, #38, #54, #60, #63, #129, #147, #162 and the fmt fix) · **Target:** Autodesk AutoCAD 2027

Every known shortfall, one row each, ranked within each section by user impact. This is the work
list: agents pick from here (top of a section first), and remove or update a row in the same PR
that closes it. Numbers and weights live in [target-app-parity.md](target-app-parity.md); hours
are Opus 5.5 agent-hours, calibrated as explained there. "Est." means a judgement from the cited
evidence. Rows marked **[alpha blocker]** are what fails the [alpha gate](roadmap.md#alpha-gate);
do them first.

## Top 10 across everything

| # | Gap | Why it ranks here | Est. | Doc |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **[alpha blocker]** **Saving drops whatever we don't model** (Unknown entities, IMAGE, layer states, block descriptions, true colours, MULTILEADER written as LEADER+MTEXT, groups, named views/UCS, foreign xdata) | Opening a colleague's DWG and saving it silently deletes content: the one thing a CAD user can't forgive | 15–25 | [file formats](file-format-parity.md) |
| 2 | **[alpha blocker]** **No real-file test corpus and no check in AutoCAD** | All 36 file tests are synthetic; nobody has verified a CADCraft DWG/DXF opens cleanly in AutoCAD | 10–15 + human | [file formats](file-format-parity.md#tests) |
| 3 | **[alpha blocker]** **Object snap tracking, extension, parallel, apparent-intersection snaps are fake** | Drafters place most points with tracking; the F11 button does nothing | 8–12 | [ui](ui-parity.md#tracking-polar-ortho-grid-and-snap--30) |
| 4 | **[alpha blocker]** **DWG always saves as R2000; DXF only R2000 ASCII; no code pages** | Can't exchange at 2018 format; pre-2007 CJK/Cyrillic files are garbled | 10–15 | [file formats](file-format-parity.md) |
| 5 | **[alpha blocker]** **Stubbed prompt options** in TRIM/EXTEND, OFFSET, ROTATE, PLINE, SPLINE, MTEXT, MLEADER, FILLET | Scripts and muscle memory hit "not available yet" in the most-used commands | 15–25 | [features](#features) |
| 6 | **Ellipse and spline geometry is tessellated** (intersections, offsets, closest points; polyline offset ignores bulges) | Coordinates are subtly wrong; offsets of ellipses come out as polylines | 30–50 | [geometry](geometry-parity.md) |
| 7 | **[alpha blocker]** **No xrefs, block editor, dynamic blocks or groups** | Most production drawings use them | 80–120 | [features](#features) |
| 8 | **No autosave, crash recovery, AUDIT or RECOVER** | Work is lost if anything goes wrong; damaged files can't be repaired | 10–15 | [features](#features) |
| 9 | **Dynamic input lacks grip input; no FROM/M2P/TK/point filters; grip options ignored** | Precision entry at the cursor is how AutoCAD is taught today | 15–25 | [ui](ui-parity.md) |
| 10 | **No CI runs the Rust tests on pull requests** (`cargo fmt` on main is fixed) | open PRs land without a gate; regressions go unseen | 2–3 | [stability](#stability) |

## File formats

Detail: [file-format-parity.md](file-format-parity.md).

| # | Gap | User impact | Est. |
|---|---|---|---|

| FF5 | **[alpha blocker]** Real-file corpus (`storytold/cadcraft-corpus`), open → save → reopen tests, black-box check in AutoCAD | High | 10–15 + human |
| FF6 | **[alpha blocker]** DWG throughput: a 10 MB DWG took ~2 min to fail (#57) | High for real projects | 6–10 |

## Hardware

Detail: [hardware-parity.md](hardware-parity.md).

| # | Gap | Est. |
|---|---|---|
| H1 | 3Dconnexion SpaceMouse (needs the device and 3D views) | 6–10 + human |
| H2 | Multi-monitor: floating palettes on other screens, per-monitor DPI (PR #110 for Windows 11 DPI) | 4–6 |
| H3 | Plotters and system printers (PC3 devices) beyond PDF files | 6–10 |
| H4 | Pen tablets / digitizer (TABLET) | 3–5 + human |
| H5 | Screen magnifier tracking (#39, PR #187) | 1–2 |

## Localization

Detail: [localization-parity.md](localization-parity.md).

| # | Gap | Est. |
|---|---|---|
| L1 | Catalog covers the UI (936 rows, #36) but not engine diagnostics, CLI/MCP replies or command history | 4–6 |
| L2 | AutoCAD for Mac's 7 other languages (zh-Hans, es, fr, ja, de, ko, it) plus pt, hi, ar, id, vi from the standard's list | 40–60 + native review |
| L3 | Complex-script shaping (Arabic, Devanagari) and bidi/RTL in drawing text and UI | 30–45 |
| L4 | IME fixes on every platform (PRs #110–#119); vertical text styles | 6–10 |

## Stability

| # | Gap | Evidence | Est. |
|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | No CI runs `cargo xtask ci` on pull requests (only packaging lint and release builds) | `.github/workflows/` | 2–3 |
| S2 | ~~`cargo fmt --check` fails on main~~ fixed on main (8fceaaf) | — | 0 |
| S3 | 47 open PRs, many community bug fixes awaiting review | `gh pr list` | 10–20 |
| S4 | Open correctness issues: extents union far-apart geometry (#166), lines not visible mid-command (#44, PR #56), browser save/plot deliver nothing (#133, #134), closing a tab switches drawings (#76, PR #192) | issues | 6–10 |
| S5 | No smoke test of every command through the UI (PR #42 proposes one) | — | 6–10 |
| S6 | No property-based or fuzz tests for geometry; hostile-input tests cover parsing only | [geometry-parity](geometry-parity.md#tests) | 4–6 |

## Platforms

| # | Gap | Est. |
|---|---|---|
| P1 | Web build: File > Open does nothing (#55, PR #199), saves don't download (#133, PR #193), plot shows raw PDF bytes (#134), no DWG | 6–10 |
| P2 | Windows and Linux get little runtime testing; Linux Mint mouse delay (#25); Windows magnifier (#39) | 6–10 |
| P3 | macOS file associations: opening `.dxf` from Finder fails (#158) | 1–2 |

## Ecosystem and automation

| # | Gap | Est. |
|---|---|---|
| E1 | AutoLISP interpreter (safe subset first: `defun`, `command`, `entget`/`entmod`, selection sets, `getpoint` …), APPLOAD, `acad.lsp` startup | 60–100 |
| E2 | SCRIPT command reading `.scr` files (scripts run today through CLI/MCP/control only) | 1–2 |
| E3 | Express Tools equivalents (TXT2MTXT, BREAKLINE, BURST, NCOPY exists, SUPERHATCH, Move/Copy/Rotate) | 30–50 |
| E4 | Plug-in API (owner decision: Rust/WASM plug-ins rather than ObjectARX/.NET) | 30–50 |
| E5 | CUI customisation and alias (`.pgp`) editor | 15–25 |

## AI features

| # | Gap | Est. |
|---|---|---|
| A1 | Smart Blocks equivalents (placement suggestions, replace, detect and convert, search), using local open models | 25–50 + model licensing |
| A2 | An in-app assistant (AutoCAD has Autodesk Assistant); CADCraft's MCP server already lets any agent drive it | 10–20 |
| A3 | Markup Assist (import markups from PDFs/images) | 10–20 |

## Revision history

| Date | Change | Summary |
