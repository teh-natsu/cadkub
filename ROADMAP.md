# CADCraft roadmap

Status as of **2026-10-07**. CADCraft targets full parity with AutoCAD (2D drafting first, then
annotation, layouts and plotting, DWG, parametrics and 3D), plus things AutoCAD doesn't have:
agent control over MCP, a scriptable CLI, a web build and a free licence.

## At a glance

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| **How close is an alpha?** | **≈ 75% of the way.** About **50 Opus 5.5 wall-clock hours** remain (≈ 15–20 hours elapsed with 3–4 agents in parallel). |
| **How far is 100% AutoCAD parity?** | **≈ 29% parity overall** (weighted by how much each area matters). About **570 Opus 5.5 wall-clock hours** remain (≈ 150–190 hours elapsed in parallel). |
| **2D drafting parity** (what most AutoCAD users do every day: M1–M8) | **≈ 55%.** About **245 hours** remain. |
| **The biggest single gap** | 3D modelling (M11): solids, surfaces, meshes, visual styles and rendering — ≈ 200 hours on its own. |

### What "alpha" means here

A person can do real 2D drafting work in CADCraft and trust it with their files:

- Installable, signed builds for macOS, Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and the web from the release pipeline.
- Drawings from AutoCAD open correctly, and CADCraft's DXF/DWG files open cleanly in AutoCAD and other readers.
- Every common 2D draw, modify, annotate, layer, block, layout and plot command works, both with the mouse and at the command line.
- No crashes and no lost work: autosave and recovery, plus undo that always works.

### Alpha checklist

| Item | State | Hours left |
|---|---|---|
| 2D draw and modify commands, snaps, tracking, grips | done (minor options missing) | — |
| Dimensions, text, MTEXT, leaders, tables, TrueType fonts | done | — |
| Hatch with pick points, blocks, attributes | done | — |
| Layouts, viewports, MSPACE/PSPACE, page setup, PLOT to PDF | done | — |
| Parametric constraints, constraint bars and dimensional constraints on the canvas, Parameters Manager | done | — |
| DXF/DWG round trip of everything above | done for our data; MULTILEADER is written as LEADER + MTEXT; `*D` dimension blocks duplicate on re-save | 6 |
| Confirmed opening in AutoCAD (black-box check) | not yet confirmed | 4 |
| Layer Properties Manager (VP overrides, states, filters), QSELECT, Quick Properties | done | — |
| Autosave, crash recovery, RECOVER/AUDIT | partial | 6 |
| Options dialog and preferences | partial | 6 |
| Plot preview | missing | 4 |
| Scripted smoke test of all 290 commands through the UI, then fixing what it finds | not started | 12 |
| Release pipeline: first green signed build on every platform | workflows written; first run being started | 6 |
| Getting-started docs and the web build hosted | partial | 4 |
| **Total** | | **≈ 50** |

## Where we are

| Measure | Value |
|---|---|
| Menu breadth (`cargo xtask parity`, [docs/parity.md](docs/parity.md)) | **233 / 491 reference menu items (47%)** |
| Registered commands | 290 (133 with interactive prompts) |
| **Estimated overall feature parity (weighted by how much each area matters)** | **≈ 29%** |
| Performance | 200k entities: pick 0.001 ms, pick after an edit ≈ 4 ms (incremental R-tree), GPU canvas ≈ 4 ms per frame |
| Tests | geometry, colour, document, fonts, render, DXF/DWG round trips, constraints solver, engine (commands, prompts, snaps, selection, undo, scripts, hostile input), MCP agent tasks, xtask |
| Gates | `cargo xtask ci`: fmt, clippy -D warnings, tests, asset attribution, layering, wasm — green |

Menu breadth counts menu items that exist; the weighted parity estimate also counts depth (options,
edge cases, dialogs), which is why it is lower.

## Milestones

| # | Milestone | Status | Estimate (Opus 5.5 wall-clock hours) |

| M0 | Skeleton + vertical slice: workspace, AutoCAD-style UI, command line, draw/modify basics, DXF, CLI, MCP, web | **done** | — |

| M11 | 3D: UCS, orbit, visual styles, solids (box…loft, booleans, fillet edges), meshes, surfaces, sections, rendering | 0% | 200 |
| M12 | Automation: an embedded safe AutoLISP-compatible interpreter, action recorder, sheet sets, CLI/MCP parity tests | ~25% | 60 |
| M13 | 1.0 polish: preferences, workspaces, themes, localisation, accessibility, signed packages for every platform, docs | ~10% | 40 |
| | **Remaining total** | | **≈ 570 hours** |

At roughly 570 more hours of Opus 5.5 wall-clock work (with parallel agents this compresses to
about 150–190 hours of elapsed time), CADCraft would reach broad AutoCAD parity. 2D drafting parity
(M1–M8) is the first ≈ 250 hours.

## Current focus

The drafting and layer-palette icon-button helper uses shared `craft-ui` interaction and accessibility,
with CADCraft's original multicolor painting and disabled appearance. This does not change drafting
commands. The native host now restores workspace visibility, toolset choices and collapsed groups;
malformed preference files are reported and preserved. Painted toolbar and document/toolset/layout
tabs expose keyboard focus and labels, and the control protocol can observe Tab/Shift-Tab traversal.
Compact windows keep toolbar command groups accessible through a More menu, while coordinates and
transient messages share an ellipsized readout that does not cover layout names.

1. Finish the alpha checklist above (release builds, AutoCAD open check, smoke test of every command, autosave/recovery, plot preview).
2. Layer filter groups, constraint bar polish (close buttons, hover highlight).
3. Native MULTILEADER objects in DXF; stop `*D` block duplication on re-save.
4. Then 3D foundations (UCS, orbit, solids via truck/csgrs per plan/adr/0001).

- **2026-10-10 (UI docking):** Tool Sets, Layers, and Properties can be regrouped, split, floated within the app window, closed, and reopened. The drawing canvas stays visible and cannot be closed or turned into a tab. Panel moves and reset are available as UI commands, and saved UI preferences retain arrangements. No milestone percentage change.
